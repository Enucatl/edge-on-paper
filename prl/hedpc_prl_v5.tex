\begin{abstract}
Phase contrast imaging with X-rays is an exciting field that reveals new insights into material properties and provides access to a complementary physical contrast mechanism to examine objects on a large range of spatial and temporal resolutions. Phase contrast imaging in the high energy range of hard X-rays, i.e. above 60 keV is still largely unexplored, as the currently availabe techniques are technically limited. Here, we demonstrate a new approach, which enables the access to the entire diagnostic energy range of X-rays for phase as well as dark field contrast imaging on laboratory systems with low brilliance X-ray sources. A phase contrast technique at such high energies is of particularly high scientific and industrial interest as it would vastly expand the range of applications, for instance, by the examination of materials of high density or thickness. The approach employs the principles of differential phase contrast imaging and involves a novel technique for diffraction grating manufacturing, allowing an illumination of the gratings in edge-on mode. Firstly, this breaks the fundamental limits of achievable grating aspect ratios, and secondly, it solves the intrinsic reduction of the field of view for the operation at high aspect ratios. Based on this, an imaging setup has been set up at a design energy of $100 \unit{keV}$. The successful step into the high diagnositc energy range paves the road for the transfer of phase contrast imaging into fields where high energies are required, such as medical CT, chip failure analysis or homeland security.

X-ray radiography and computed tomography (CT) are nowadays standard imaging techniques in materials and life science for the non-destructive examination of samples. The physical contrast mechanism relies on the attenuation of X-rays in an object through the photo-electric effect or Compton scattering, whereas two materials can be distinguished due to their different attenuation properties. Apart from the attenuation, the wave and particle nature of X-rays reveal two further physical interaction mechanisms that occur if an object is exposed to X-rays.

Regarding the wave properties, an interface of two different materials in an object causes a change in the wave's phase velocity and thus in a net change of the output phase (a phase shift) downstream of the object. Since no detection device is able to measure a phase shift directly, advanced techniques are necessary to obtain access to this signal.

Regarding the particle properties of X-rays, photons are randomly scattered on small structures in the material. Depending on the imaging system (geometry and energy), wide angle and small angle scattering represent typical sources of noise in absorption imaging. For the type of scattering which occurs exclusively in forward direction and under ultra small angles (order of nano radiants), the particles usually remain within the area of a detector pixel and thus this effect cannot directly be detected with standard techniques.

The main interest in the detectability of those additional interaction mechanisms is the fact that attenuation, phase shift and scattering are physically complementary interaction mechanisms, in the sense that their occurrence is mutually independent. This gives rise to hypothesize that the complementary interaction mechanisms may eventually yield complementary image contrasts.

A huge effort has been invested in the discovery of techniques which are sensitive to phase shift or scattering events. Since currently available phase contrast techniques rely on secondary physical effects, such as interference, and thus typically on optical hardware (e.g. crystals, gratings), they vary a lot in terms of sensitivity, practical applicability or achievable resolution. The vast majority of the methods, including crystal analyzer based \cite{Davis1995,Chapman1997} or interferometric \cite{Bonse1965,Momose1996} methods rely on X-ray beams of high spatial and temporal coherence, available only at synchrotrons. Techniques with a high degree of spectral acceptance are the in-line phase contrast method \cite{Snigirev1995,Wilkins1996,Cloetens1996} and Talbot interferometry \cite{Cloetens1997,David2002,Momose2003a}. Regarding the acceptance of X-ray beams with low temporal and spatial coherence, Talbot-Lau interferometry \cite{Pfeiffer2006} and coded apertures \cite{Munro2012} are currently the only feasible techniques.

While the reported phase contrast methods are today broadly available on synchrotrons and constantly improving on conventional X-ray tubes, none of the techniques is compatible to acquire images in the higher energy range of hard X-rays ($>50 \unit{keV}$). However, there is a large amount of potential applications which remain unexplored without the advent of advanced phase contrast methods at such high energies. For instance, medical imaging such as chest or abdominal radiography or CT, which require energies up to $150 \unit{keV}$, is still infeasible due to the technical limitations given by the insufficient spatial beam coherence for in-line methods or by the unavailable grating techology for Talbot-Lau interferometry. Spatial coherence at such high energies is problematic because of the fundamental limitation of sufficiently small focal spot sizes at a high output power. Grating fabrication is limited to X-ray energies up to approx. $50 \unit{keV}$. Below this energy, Talbot-Lau interferometry is well established, which partly explains the reported successes of the technique in mammography \cite{Stampanoni2011} or hand imaging \cite{Thuering2013a}. The fundamental limiting factor is the aspect ratio $\textnormal{AR} = 2h/p$, where $p$ is the grating period and $h$ the structure height. This ratio cannot be aribtrarily high, as grating structures tend to collapse or to deform due to capillary forces. For a given setup distance and for $p \propto 1/\sqrt{E}$ and $h \propto E^3$, it can be shown that $\textnormal{AR} \propto E^{7/2}$. While for $25 \unit{keV}$, an aspect ratio for the absorption grating of around $\textnormal{AR}=30$ is necessary for a reasonable setup length, it would have to be at least 128 for $100 \unit{keV}$. This is only approximate and ignores absorption edges of the materials (e.g., at around $80 \unit{keV}$ for gold in an absorption grating). Furthermore, when using a polychromatic spectrum, photons above the design energy should also be efficiently attenuated by the gratings to guarantee their contribution to the signal, which requires even higher aspect ratios. The limitation is usually at around $\textnormal{AR} = 60$, whereas such high values are often even beyond the limits and come at the expense of a poor grating quality and performance.

Here, we propose novel approach, which allows phase contrast and dark field imaging with low brilliance X-ray tubes at arbitrarily high energies. The approach is based on a new grating design, aiming at the edge-on illumination of gratings. Edge-on illumination, as opposed to face-on illumination, exploits the dimension along the grating lines to form a high aspect ratio of the structures in beam direction. The effective structure height of the grating is then determined by the grating dimension, which essentially means that the aspect ratio can be arbitrarily high. FIG.~\ref{Fig:schematic} illustrates the edge-on illumination approach.
\begin{figure} [ht]
  \includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{figures/figure1.eps}
  \caption{Schematic of a grating interferometer for high X-ray energies in edge-on illumination mode. The aspect ratio is defined by the ratio of the travelling distance along the grating lines and the period and can be arbitrarily long. In order to avoid a reduction of the field of view, the grating structures are aligned on an arc.}
  \label{Fig:schematic}
\end{figure}

Increasing the effective aspect ratio of the gratings typically leads to a reduction of the field of view due to the change of the transmission function at high incident angles, which has also been demonstrated by using a glancing angle of the gratings between zero and $90$ degrees \cite{Stutman2012a}. In order to overcome this problem in edge-on illuminated grating interferometry, the grating lines are aligned on an arc with a radius equal to the distance from the source to the grating (FIG.~\ref{Fig:schematic}).

The combination of edge-on illumination and the circularly curved structure alignment allows the design of a grating interferometer at any design energy in the diagnostic energy range of X-rays. The arbitrary aspect ratio only comes at the expense of a limited field of view in the vertical dimension of the image plane, which is, depending on the detector, typically a few pixels. However, radiographic 2D images can still be acquired in sample scanning mode without increasing dose. Similarly, for tomographic images, the approach allows single slice CT or full 3D imaging in scanning mode.

Gratings were manufactured by Micro Works GmbH, Germany, using a LIGA process \cite{Kenntner2010}. The grating design and fabrication is non-standard and involves a complex mask design, as shown in FIG.~\ref{Fig:grating_mask}. Each grating resides on a $5 \times 60 \unit{mm^2}$ silicon chip and has its specific structure length and curvature. Several grating chips can be fabricated on a single 4 inch silicon wafer. For the present experiments, a symmetric interferometer with a grating period of $p = 2.8 \unit{\upmu m}$ for all gratings has been used. The design energy is $100 \unit{keV}$ and the beam splitter grating periodically shifts the phase by zero and $\pi$ at this energy. Using gold as the phase shifting material, this requires a structure length of $b = 19.8 \unit{\upmu m}$. The analyzer grating is an absorption mask for sensing the changes of the interference pattern generated by the beam splitter. With a structure length of $b = 800 \unit{\upmu m}$, this grating has an aspect ratio of approx. 570 and thus sufficiently attenuates X-rays up to energies of around $160 \unit{keV}$. Beam splitter- and analyzer grating are separated at the first fractional Talbot order and the distance from the source grating to the analyzer grating is $32 \unit{cm}$. The source grating is positioned $23 \unit{cm}$ away from the source and has the structure length is also  $800 \unit{\upmu m}$.

The X-ray source is a COMET MXR-160HP/11 X-ray tube with a maximum output voltage of $160 \unit{kV}$. Since the absorption gratings perform efficiently up to $160 \unit{keV}$ and the spectral acceptance at the first fractional Talbot order is high ($50 \unit{keV}$ to $>160 \unit{keV}$), the tube voltage was set to the maximum of $160 \unit{kV}$ and operated at a current of $10 \unit{mA}$. The focal spot size is approx. $1 \unit{mm}$. The detector is a CCD camera from Finger Lakes Instruments. A cesium iodide (CsI) scintillator of $600 \unit{\upmu m}$ thickness converts the X-rays to visible light and is coupled with an optical lens projecting the image onto the CCD. The effective pixel size is $80 \unit{\upmu m}$. With a grating structure height of approx. $100 \unit{\upmu m}$, the field of view in the vertical direction is limited to one pixel row. In addition to the standard components (source, camera, interferometer), two optical slit, one in front of the source grating, the other in front of the camera, have been installed for the collimation of the beam in vertical direction. X-rays which are not travelling through all of the gratings do not contribute to the signal and are attenuated by the slits. The slit widths are $25 \unit{\upmu m}$ and $100 \unit{\upmu m}$, respectively.

FIG. 3 shows a radiographic image of a metal screw in all three contrast modes, acquired with the $100 \unit{keV}$ setup. Grating interferometry at such a high diagnostic energy allows to examine more dense materials such as metals in phase contrast mode. At lower energies, the phase shifts of such materials would be too large and wrap over multiple periods of the analyzer grating.


Edge-on illuminated grating interferometry breaks the current limitation to the low diagnostic energy range for X-ray phase contrast imaging with conventional X-ray sources. Compact geometries for design energies well above 100 keV can be realized for the examination of dense materials which would be intransparent at lower energies of currently used phase contrast techniques. The approach is not limited to X-ray imaging, it can also be applied to other grating based imaging modalities (e.g., with neutrons \cite{Grunzweig2008}) where high aspect ratios are necessary.
